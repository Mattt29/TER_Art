                <p>
                    During our first year of the Master's program, we were
                    assigned a research project. <br><br>The objective of this
                    project is to design an architecture able to process a
                    large set of image data and to transform them in order
                    to reveal, or not, relationships between them. To process the images, we used tools studied in class
                    such as dimension reduction and classification using deep learning.

                    The potential applications of this tool are multiple and
                    could be applied to many fields:
